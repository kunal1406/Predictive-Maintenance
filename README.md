# Predictive-Maintenance

# Problem

The core problem revolves around predictive maintenance, which aims to predict machinery failures before they occur. This not only prevents costly downtime but also saves on maintenance costs by performing maintenance tasks only when necessary. By effectively predicting machine failures, the company can optimize maintenance schedules, reduce maintenance costs, and extend the lifespan of their equipment.
